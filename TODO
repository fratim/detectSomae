Question:
1. Do we have somae data for the mouse in a higher resolution?
2. What to do about gaps in the segmentation?
3. Check for first few slices (wrong annotation?) (also do so for last slices)
4. use tf.dataset


Idea:
1. Implement more data augmentation

TODO:
1. write refinement of Somae to use numba or write it in c++
2. incorporate resolution into mouse somae cutting
3. implement on the fly computation of weights for weighted loss

Questions to Alex:
1. Will there also be cuts in the brain data segmentation?
2. Do we already have synapses for the brain segmentation?
3. What is the maximum distance to still project synapses?

Paper Questions:
1. Are there any ideas on space per topic yet?
2. Which software/ layout do we use for graphs and visuals?
3. Any other already made decisions?
4. Can we assume everything written in your paper to be known?
5. How much is this going to be a manual?
6. Which other chapters will we have?

Status:
1. Somae detection improved had some issues with generalization that I think are fixed
2. Asked Donglai about JWR, there apparently is a small bug but should be fixed soon

Things to do:
1. Proofread some Zebrafinch Somaes
2. Is width estimation working?
3. blocksize Experiment
4. runtime
5. run CC to get largest on Zebrafinch
6. Hole filling runtime improvement
7. Hole statistics
8. Run statistics also on JWR
9. Figures
