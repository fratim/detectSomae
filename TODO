Question:
1. Do we have somae data for the mouse in a higher resolution?
2. What to do about gaps in the segmentation?

Idea:
1. Implement more data augmentation

TODO:
1. write refinement of Somae to use numba or write it in c++
2. incorporate resolution into mouse somae cutting

Questions to Alex:
1. Will there also be cuts in the brain data segmentation?
2. Do we already have synapses for the brain segmentation?
3. What is the maximum distance to still project synapses?
