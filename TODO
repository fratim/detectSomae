Question:
1. Do we have somae data for the mouse in a higher resolution?
2. What to do about gaps in the segmentation?
3. Check for first few slices (wrong annotation?) (also do so for last slices)
4. use tf.dataset


Idea:
1. Implement more data augmentation

TODO:
1. write refinement of Somae to use numba or write it in c++
2. incorporate resolution into mouse somae cutting
3. implement on the fly computation of weights for weighted loss

Questions to Alex:
1. Will there also be cuts in the brain data segmentation?
2. Do we already have synapses for the brain segmentation?
3. What is the maximum distance to still project synapses?
